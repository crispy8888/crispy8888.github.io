<p>“What makes you different from everyone else?”</p>

<p>It’s the question that a lot of business owners and builders aren’t prepared to answer. Heck, I have had people ask me that question about big companies I’ve worked for, and I have struggled on occasion to answer that. “Well, we do a lot of things, we…”</p>

<!--more-->

<p>And when you get to enterprise-scale concerns, you can be forgiven for not being able to represent the breadth of your company’s offerings in a tight elevator pitch. However, you’re not building an enterprise right now. You’re building a small business. (Please don’t call it a startup. Startups are different, as I’ll describe later in this series.)</p>

<h2 id="what-really-is-a-unique-selling-proposition-anyway">What really IS a unique selling proposition, anyway?</h2>

<p>So a USP is not your company vision or mission. People do not <em>buy</em> because you represent your business as “endeavoring to create sustainable and locally-sourced wood products to discerning builders”. People buy your products over your competitor’s products for the following reasons (mostly):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Better price</li>
  <li>Better value</li>
  <li>More options</li>
  <li>Highly unique</li>
  <li>Higher quality</li>
  <li>More convenient</li>
  <li>More time saved</li>
  <li>Faster delivery</li>
  <li>Cheaper delivery</li>
  <li>Best after-sales care</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice a few keywords in there: better, faster, cheaper, more. We joke about those factors (“good, fast or cheap, pick two”) but in the end, the buyer’s mind will gravitate to a maximal evaluation of those three factors – either your products are better, they’re available sooner, or they’re priced lower. If not, they’ll move on.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-you-focus-on-for-your-unique-selling-proposition">What should you focus on for your unique selling proposition?</h2>

<p>Going for “priced lower” isn’t always the best option. In fact, it’s usually your avenue of last resort. That’s because lower-priced products creates a race to the bottom, and in 2023, there are massive platforms that encourage and even facilitate a race to the bottom.</p>

<p>A few years back, dropshipping and arbitrage was king: buy stuff cheaply overseas and resell it for a profit. But then platforms like AliExpress and Temu jumped in, and you can get nearly any piece of crap you want for next to nothing. So they’re starting to nibble away at the general-audience dropshipping market… and their margins.</p>

<p>So that leaves us with a few things that we could focus on in our fledgling business:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Value</li>
  <li>Options</li>
  <li>Uniqueness</li>
  <li>Quality</li>
  <li>Convenience</li>
  <li>Time-saving</li>
  <li>Speed</li>
  <li>Customer care</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, in a customer goods business, you want to focus on the sale. You want that initial purchase from someone to feel good and to satisfy their immediate needs.</p>

<p>They’re not going to buy because they get excellent post-purchase support from you (at that point, you’re edging up on becoming a service-focused business, like selling coffee machines and then selling great support contracts). That’s more of a repeat-business strategy.</p>

<p>So that takes “Customer care” off the list.</p>

<p>Next to consider is “uniqueness”. That’s actually quite hard to do in the digital age. The cute T-shirt design you saw on Pinterest is currently being converted into a SVG file and being sold to 1,000 people through Temu or Etsy already. Design and brand piracy is rampant.</p>

<p>And if you are truly creating unique products, then you’re into the realm of handcraft, as opposed to consumer goods. It’s not a bad place to be; it’s just that handcraft doesn’t scale.</p>

<p>So that takes “Uniqueness” off the list.</p>

<p>Next to consider is “quality”. Your goods could be the highest-quality ones around, but the sad fact is that in 2023, that no longer matters. That’s due to two factors (well, three really): (a) the rising floor of the quality of overseas goods is rising, (b) and we’ve already talked about the falling ceiling of price.</p>

<p>So the converging vectors of quality and price are two forces you can’t fight. The third one, (c) is that the word “quality” has lost all meaning in 2023. It’s overused, no one believes it, so it does you no good to try to compete on quality.</p>

<p>Strike “Quality” from that list.</p>

<p>You’re left with the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Value</li>
  <li>Options</li>
  <li>Convenience</li>
  <li>Time-saving</li>
  <li>Speed</li>
</ul>

<p>That’s a decent set of things to start building your USP with. Pick two.</p>

<h2 id="framework-for-a-simple-and-effective-unique-selling-proposition">Framework for a simple and effective unique selling proposition</h2>

<p>In my business, I’m focusing on my local market, because I can work my network first. Because I’m not outsourcing the value-add portion of my business, I can turn orders around quickly, even overnight or same-day if necessary (speed). And because my first few months’ worth of sales should be mostly local, I’m planning on hand-delivering as many orders to clients as I can (convenience). So I’m hitting “speed” and “convenience” as my first effort.</p>

<p>Translating those two qualities into a USP could take multiple forms. But generally, think about what the client’s pain points are,and present it as a solution to them in the general form:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Eliminate (insert client’s pain point here)</li>
  <li>with</li>
  <li>first quality of your USP</li>
  <li>and</li>
  <li>second quality of your USP</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s say that you want to want to provide beautiful, live-edge hardwood slabs to custom furniture makers. Now, you can buy these live-edge slabs at the lumber store, but the issue is that the store sells them in pre-cut lengths and widths, and if you cut or mark them in any way, the store won’t take them back.</p>

<p>You, as a lumber miller, can cut them to any size, and you don’t have a huge problem accepting returns of the slabs, because in most cases you could resell the 8-foot length as a cut 3-foot and 5-foot length to other prospective customers.</p>

<p>So your USP features could be one of the following:</p>

<p>Value</p>

<p>Options</p>

<p>Convenience</p>

<p><del>Time-saving</del></p>

<p><del>Speed</del></p>

<p>“Value” can be subjective with this product, so I’ll do with “options” and “convenience”.</p>

<p>Using the framework above, the potential USP for this business becomes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>“Never worry about wastage again, with slabs custom-cut to any length, and our flexible return policy!”</li>
</ul>

<p>If I’m a furniture maker and I DGAF about wastage, then I’m not your market. But if I <em>hate</em> having to cut seven inches off of the slabs I buy at the lumber store (that’s money on the floor), then I am your market.</p>

<h2 id="using-your-usp-to-keep-you-focused">Using your USP to keep you focused.</h2>

<p>On the surface, a USP looks like a marketing phrase. But it also has power in helping you focus your efforts when building your business.</p>

<p>Having a core USP helps you (a) tightly define your target market, and (b) helps keep you on track when you will (and you will!) want to stray from your original path to start offering X and Y and P and Q as well before you’ve had enough time to evaluate version 1.0 of your business.</p>

<p>There are lots of qualities that you need in order to build a successful business. Tenacity. Vision. Imagination. Execution.</p>

<p>I’m not sure if I have those qualities, but I am proud to say that I’m “lazy” and “cheap”. Those qualities aren’t commonly quoted amongst the #hustle crowd, but that’s what I have at my disposal, so hey-ho, here we go.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’m smack in the middle of building a consumer goods business based around high-powered diode laser engraving. (Did I also mention that I have a terrible habit of taking the safety guards off of all of my dangerous tools? Add “foolhardy” to “lazy” and “cheap”.)</p>

<p>I’ve only spent mayyybe about 15 hours total on ramping this business up, and if things go well (and I don’t laser off any large appendages in the process) then it should be live this week.</p>

<p>What I find interesting, though, is two things: (a) how many different tech platforms I’m using to support the business, and (b) how easy and cheap most of those platforms are to set up for a SMB.</p>

<p>I thought you might be interested to see how I built this business, from the strategy, to the tech platforms I used, to the things that I <em>didn’t</em> do.</p>

<p>So here are my rough notes on how I built out this business for your benefit. Best consumed with a grain of salt. 🧂</p>

<h2 id="what-you-need-to-bootstrap-your-consumer-goods-based-business-as-an-mvp">What you need to bootstrap your consumer-goods based business as an MVP</h2>

<p>Oh, the arguments I’ve had over the years about what constitutes a true Minimum Viable Product. Oh my oh my.</p>

<p>But this is my site, and it’s my business, so here’s my personal definition of what should be in an MVP, at least when it comes to online businesses in the consumer goods space:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A straightforward Unique Selling Proposition (USP)</li>
  <li>Enough polish to your online presence to not look any worse than your competitors</li>
  <li>A “good-enough” logo and branding</li>
  <li>A business name that you don’t have to explain †</li>
  <li>Communication channels for the business that won’t gum up my own personal communications</li>
  <li>Accounting and inventory packages that don’t get in the way</li>
  <li>Email, phone number or SMS collection facility</li>
  <li>Capital †† and equipment †††</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>† The best business names</strong>, when you’re starting out, are <em>ones that you don’t have to explain</em>. You want people to know <em>immediately</em> what your business offers. 
Does that result in a boring name? Possibly. Does it matter? Not usually. Does it make registering your business easier with various governmental authorities? Almost always.</p>

<p>Honestly, one of the best business names I’ve seen is on a sign tacked to a telephone pole just down the road from my house. All it states is “Dave’s Stump Grinding” and a phone number. You know instantly who you’re talking to (Dave), what the offer is on the table (getting your stumps ground) and a number to call.</p>

<p>When you’re a multimillion-dollar global concern, <em>then</em> you can worry about branding and naming and trademarking and shit like that. But for now? Keep it simple.</p>

<p><strong>†† A lot of people say that the best businesses to start</strong> are those that don’t need <em>any</em> capital, and they’re right. Start a service-based or information-based business as your first gig and keep at it, because it will have infinite ROI and a hella-easy accounting system (send out invoices, pay your taxes, and done).</p>

<p>But if you’re looking to build your business to sell down the road (and if you’re not planning on that, you should be), small to medium service-based businesses are a <em>hard</em> sell, especially when the founder still plays a big role in the day-to-day of the company. That’s a whole other article in itself. And when I refer to “capital” here, I’m talking about owner capital. Do <em>not</em> go get a loan to start a small consumer goods business. Or maybe any business, unless you know exactly what you’re doing. There are lots of bootstrapping and fund-finding opportunities that you can take advantage of right now that don’t require bank loans.</p>

<p><strong>††† Investing in equipment</strong> is not necessarily a <em>bad</em> thing when it comes to starting a business. Equipment is one of those real and tangible artifacts from the brick and mortar days that banks and the tax people understand innately. You can write off the depreciation on your taxes, it is easy to use as part of valuing the business, and if things go south, you can even sell it to minimize your losses or to free up cash that you can use in other areas of the business. As long as the equipment is still functional, that is, so keep it in good order.</p>

<p>And yes, I <em>could</em> have outsourced the value-add part of this business to avoid buying equipment, but (a) I like tinkering, so don’t take that away from me, and (b) at the moment I am simultaneously the cheapest and most expensive person I can hire right now. I have a surplus of time, so I’m choosing to burn that instead of burning capital.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-dont-need-to-start-your-business-not-yet-anyway">What you don’t need to start your business (not yet, anyway)</h2>

<p>You don’t have funding to burn. Here’s a short and incomplete list of what you <em>don’t</em> need to start your business. (Did I mention you don’t have funding to burn?)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Business cards. No one uses these anymore. Now, I <em>will</em> talk leave-behind cards in a bit (which come in business card format) but they’re different and don’t need to be procured until later in the process. Spend zero time designing a business card right now.</li>
  <li>A new computer. Most of what I will cover in this series about business-building can be done from your mobile phone, and a computer with a browser. I suspect even a cheap Chromebook might work.</li>
  <li>A new phone. What you have right now will work just fine. And you don’t need “a separate line for business”. I’ll cover “business phone numbers” later in this series.</li>
  <li>An office or a co-working space. If you can’t work from home, find a separate, quiet place to work, like the library (which has free computers for your use), or a quiet coffee shop or something.</li>
  <li>A designer or branding agency or anything like that. In 2023 you don’t need to be a designer; you just need to have an eye for “yeah, that doesn’t look like total shite.”</li>
  <li>Stickers or water bottles or an embroidered shirt or any swag like that.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, you need to be <em>brutally honest</em> when looking at what you need to launch a business. It’s easy to get carried away at “playing business” but the fact is that you aren’t really in business until the revenue starts to flow. Before that, you’re just goofing off.</p>

<h2 id="knowing-where-the-good-enough-line-is">Knowing where the “good enough” line is</h2>

<p>I think sometimes people aren’t quite sure about where the “good enough” line sits for launching a small business. I have friends who have invested nearly $10,000 into their business through talking to lawyers, hiring a developer, and engaging a design and branding firm <em>without even knowing if their idea was viable</em>. What’s implicit here is that you should be launching a consumer goods business that’s already been proven and has some competition out there. Because if multiple people are doing it and seem to be viable, <em>they’ve already tested out the idea for you</em>. Take a page out of the late Steve Job’s playbook and take inspiration from the businesses around you — and then iterate on existing ideas. That’s where success is to be found.</p>

<h2 id="the-rest-of-this-series">The rest of this series</h2>

<p>As this intro post is getting long, I’ll be dropping future articles in this series several times a week, as I get to them. I hope it’s a good read, and I hope you find it useful.</p>
