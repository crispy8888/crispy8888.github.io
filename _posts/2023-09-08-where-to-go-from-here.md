A ship is safe in the harbor,

But that's not what ships are built for.

<!--more-->

Because in the sum of our human gleams,

We have created the vessel for our dreams.

Its purpose: to retrieve the alien shore,

To scout, seek, achieve and explore.

A ship is meant to fly and fly,

To seize the horizon and capture the sky.

And the few of us with the intrepidity,

To brave the virulent vortex velocity

We are the wealthiest of men ever to dream

And ever to combat a sea or a stream.

And the harbored ships that fritter away,

Slowly begin to rot and decay.

Never has there been a greater waste of a day,

Than that spent harbored,

Than those of us who stay.
