![profile picture](/assets/images/chris-belanger-profile.jpg)

I've done various things during my career — enterprise e-health programmer, database analyst, air-based surveillance programmer, real-time industrial systems tech, editor-in-chief, chief marketing officer, and head of community. Throw in author, composer and copywriter, and that mostly rounds things out.

I'm currently working towards my next big adventure. But in the meantime, I figured I'd start writing down some of the things I've learned in tech and business (and some of the things that I'm still learning) and share some of that with you. Read what you like, take away the things that you want, but most of all, use what I share here to keep on making great things.
